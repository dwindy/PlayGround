CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:11 (Find_Package):
  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable G2O_ROOT is set to:

    /home/xin/Downloads/g2o

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/180/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (CSPARSE)
  does not match the name of the calling package (CSparse).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /home/xin/Downloads/g2o/cmake_modules/FindCSparse.cmake:26 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:13 (Find_Package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
